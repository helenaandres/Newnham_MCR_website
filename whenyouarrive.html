        <h1>When you Arrive</h1>
        <p> This is a very quick guide to some things you may want to bring with you when you come up to college. Some of these items will vary depending on your personal needs and where you’re travelling from, so some of these are more applicable to international students. If you have any questions please do post to the Newnham MCR facebook page and email a member of the MCR committee (e.g. International Officer, Welfare, the President) and we’ll do our best to help.
        </p>

        <h4>Paperwork</h4>

        <p> 
          <ul>
            <li> Bring copies of major correspondence from college and your department (offer letters, funding details, accommodation notifications, orientation information etc.).</li>
            <li> Copies of your relevant degree certificates etc. these might be needed to confirm your registration if this has not already been done (depending on the finish/graduation date of your last course). </li>
            <li> Bank account details where relevant, you can request a letter from college when you arrive to help you set up a UK bank account ASAP, it's worth setting up meetings at your bank of choice and back ups well in advance and allow for a week for college to get you the relevant documents. </li>
            <li> Your passport and visa documentation (international only) and other ID such as driver’s license, you’ll have to pick up your BRP (biometric residency permit) in the first few days in Cambridge, and should have your time slot for this booked in advance. </li>
            <li> Any relevant NHS details for UK residents and a letter from your doctor at home for international students summarising any medications or conditions you need doctor’s here in the UK to know about.  </li>

          </ul>


        <h4>Clothes</h4>

        <p> 
          <ul>
            <li> All the formal wear you own! The beginning of the academic year brings lots of formal events, both with and without gowns so make sure you have formal hall and drinks reception appropriate clothing. Newnham has no specific rules about what to wear to matriculation, but what you wear should be business formal to cocktail. </li>
            <li> Some warm clothing, winter often comes swiftly in Cambridge so make sure you have a good coat and some jumpers at the ready. </li>
            <li> Wet weather clothing, Cambridgeshire is the driest county in the UK but it's still a good idea to have a waterproof jacket/coat and some sturdy shoes for walking around the fenland.</li>
            <li> Most rooms have some leftover coathangers in the wardrobe but it's a good idea to stick a few in your suitcase.  </li>

          </ul>


        <h4>Bedding</h4>

        <p> 
          <ul>
            <li> All college rooms come with a mattress and mattress protector, pillows with protectors and cases, sheets, duvet and duvet cover and towel, which you can exchange once per week. If you wish to bring your own you can return these to the linen room (or any part of that package) but make sure if you do you get a receipt. If you’d like anything extra please do bring this along, or buy it when you get here (electric blanket - make sure it gets PAT certified, extra cushions etc.)</li>
          
          </ul>          
        </p>

        <h4>Crockery, Cutlery, Mugs, Cooking Equipment:</h4>

        <p> 
          <ul>
            <li> The amount of free/leftover kitchenware in accommodation varies and it’s safer to assume items belong to your housemates. Its best to have at least a mug ready to go for those late night tea sessions. The rest can easily be bought at charity shops, Poundland or Wilko. </li>
          </ul>
        </p>

        <h4>Computing Equipment:</h4>

        <p> 
          <ul>
            <li> We have two well equipped computer rooms, one in the library and one in Sidgwick, however your own laptop will make things a lot easier, and means you can work in a more mobile manner if need be. </li>

          </ul>
        </p>

        <h4>Leads, Plugs etc.:</h4>

        <p> 
          <ul>
            <li> Extension leads and power boards are an essential item (but must be PAT tested), most of our properties are older buildings and often have plugs in weird places. Make sure you get items converted to UK plugs as converters aren’t allowed in college. </li>

          </ul>
        </p>

        <h4>Room Decorations:</h4>

        <p> 
          <ul>
            <li> Graduate leases are year long, so its important to make your room feel like home. In some cases you might end up staying in your room for all 3 years of your PhD.  </li>

          </ul>
        </p>

        <h4>Stationary</h4>

        <p> 
          <ul>
            <li> There will be a lot of inductions and information in the first few weeks so it might be a good idea to slip a pen, highlighter and small notebook into your suitcase, also be prepared to fill up your diary/calendar, there’s always a lot on in Cambridge! </li>

          </ul>
        </p>

        <h4>Other</h4>

        <p> 
          <ul>
            <li> Essential medications, goes without saying but just in case… </li>
            <li> Tubs and boxes for additional storage, might be worth considering or buying when you arrive  </li>

          </ul>
        </p>

        <h2>Things to buy in your first week or to wait and see:</h2>

        <p> 
          <ul>
            <li> Gown - in Welcome Week the tutorial office will be selling these at a discount, so will the two major robemakers in town (Ryder and Amies - the cheapest option if you go for second hand, and Ede and Ravenscroft). The type of gown you will get depends on your age and if you have previously graduated from Cambridge. This might also be different to the type of gown you’ll graduate in, so best to wait and ask, the robemakers know their stuff. A gown is compulsory for Solemn Admission (studentship holders), Matriculation and the Graduate Feast so this is a PRIORITY, gowns can cost between £40-100 depending on what type you need and where you get it from.</li>
            <li> Bike - lots of the bicycle shops will have deals on, but also be wary of freshers inflation, there are always plenty on sale on gumtree etc. so see how far you need to travel and what the costs are. </li>
            <li> The rest of your stationary - there are lots of stationary shops in Cambridge so the bulk of your pens, folders, notepads etc. can be bought in town OR you can get a lot of these things for free at the Freshers Fair on Parker’s Piece/Kelsey Kerridge Sports complex </li>
            <li> Kettle, toaster, sandwich makers etc. - most graduate houses owned by college will have most of these items, and many are not allowed in student rooms, but some items if you’d like to use them in communal kitchens can be bought here in the UK. </li>
            <li> Printer - college has 2 printing/computer rooms, and most departments have their own arrangements for graduates, but you might want your own personal one</li>
            <li> Long mirrors - some college rooms will have had these left by previous tenants or built in, they’re easily purchasable on gumtree, from Wilko or Amazon. </li>
            <li> Books - if you’re a PhD student you might have your own collection of relevant works that you’d like to bring, and these can be shipped to the porters lodge, along with any other items but arrange this with the porters in advance as they have limited space for large storage. For other key texts and any textbooks for students on taught courses, we have an amazing library at college, and all departments also have their own libraries as well as the University LIbrary (UL) which gets a copy of every book published in the UK and Ireland, additionally you will have access to a huge range of digital resources. You can request for any of the libraries to which you below to purchase any books you need. Ask around for any second hand books, and don’t forget Cambridge is full of great second hand and antique bookshops as well as Heffers, the Cambridge University Press and Waterstones.</li>
            <li>Pre-paid event tickets, the majority of the events we organise and endorse at Newnham are completely free, so we wary of anything advertised online. Check with us before you buy anything, we might have already organised tickets for you. We’ll post up the Welcome Week schedule in late summer so check that first.</li>
            <li> Most of Newnham’s rooms also have electric heaters provided so check what your room has when you arrive first.</li>


          </ul>
        </p>


        <h2>What you shouldn’t bring:</h2>

        <p> 
          <ul>
            <li> A car - parking in Cambridge is a nightmare and parking permits are a rare commodity, so best to leave this at home unless you need it for mobility or fieldwork. If you do require a car, contact the head porter to arrange a parking permit.</li>
            <li> Candles - these are banned in Newnham as they are a fire risk, but you can buy nice electric ones, or bring fairy lights for ambience. </li>
            <li> Furniture - all college rooms, and most private rentals, have a bed, desk, lamp, chair, shelves/bookcase, dresser and wardrobe included. Many of Newnham’s rooms also have lovely antique furniture items for extra storage. Iron and ironing board - most of the graduate houses come equipped with these </li>
            <li>If you don’t have a Microsoft Office package don’t buy one before you arrive – with your new University account you will be able to claim Office 365 ProPlus for free. If you need 3 any specialist software for your degree, the University will have a free subscription. You don’t need to pay for your own expensive software! </li>

          </ul>
