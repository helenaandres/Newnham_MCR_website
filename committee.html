                  <p>Hi everyone! I’m Sam, a second year PhD student researching major social and religious changes in Anglo-Saxon England utilising stable isotope analysis in the Department of Archaeology. I’m your president for this year, meaning I’m the first port of call for any MCR and graduate studies questions you might have if you’re otherwise unsure of whom to talk to. As president it is my job to help the other officers run great events and provide a variety of support services for you, as well as maintain a great safe space inside the MCR itself to socialise and work.  It is also my job alongside the Governing Body rep and the External Officer to represent you all at larger College and University level meetings. 
                  A little more about me: I’m an Australian, sport enthusiast, travel obsessive and Netflix junkie. I’m a perpetual student and researcher, and therefore really understand the myriad of challenges and fantastic opportunities we face as graduate students. We have a brilliantly unique college experience here at Newnham, full of amazing women who are constant sources of inspiration, encouragement and support. Welcome to this great community, I hope to meet you all around college soon!</p>

I'm one of the Welfare Officers this year, which means it's my job to signpost students who are looking for some help. During your graduate studies you may find that you are in need of some extra support and at Cambridge and Newnham there a lot of services available to you. Whether you are dealing with issues related to your mental health, financial concerns, physical wellbeing, or problems with your studies, you can contact me or my co-officer Katerina for guidance about where to go to access different services. Similarly, if you just want have a chat with a friendly ear you can always drop me a message - this is my fourth year in Cambridge and so I have had some experience with the trials and tribulations, both personal and academic, that can arise while studying here. As Welfare Officers, Katerina and I will also be arranging different Welfare events throughout the year, so you can look out for these by email, on Facebook, and the MCR calendar. </p>

                  <p>Hannah is an English-Irish-American-South African, which really just means people think she is foreign where ever she goes.

Hannah is currently a second year Ph.D. student studying drug resistance in the Malaria Parasite. She would like to reassure all liberal arts students that she is very unlikely to accidentally infect you.
                  She was previously a very active member of the Imperial queer and feminist society. During her time at Newnham, she hopes to provide a sense of community by organizing a series of queer-focused events both in and outside college as well as by providing confidential support to anyone who needs it </p>

I’m originally from Germany and Brazil, but before coming to Cambridge I spent much of my life in Africa and the Middle East. What makes Cambridge an extraordinary place to be is the holistic experience of life as a Cantab. It’s the confluence of rigorous academics and dynamic social and intellectual communities that holds great promise for growth at both the individual and collective levels. Though you’ll always find lectures and panels throughout the University at large, as Guest Speaker Organiser I cannot wait to invite speakers with particular relevance to Newnham’s postgraduates. To this end, I’ll be consulting with both the MCR and postgraduates to make discretionary decisions on which exciting guest speakers to host. Do contact me if you have any special requests!
