      <h2> Women's</h2>
      <p> Here at Newnham, we are passionate about women’s rights, education and empowerment. Women are underrepresented at a Graduate level in the university, and so it is vital that women are supported and heard in all aspects of their graduate career. </br>
      </br>
      At Newnham we have an MCR Women’s Officer whose role it is to be a general focal point for these issues at Newnham, and she organises events and represents Newnham at the University level on these issues. If you have a passion for gender equality and would like to run an event, for example a discussion on a particular topic, a book group or organise a group from Newnham to attend a march please email the Women’s Officer (mcr.womens@newn.cam.ac.uk). Equally please just email her if you have any concerns or questions. </br>
      </br>
      We also at Newnham have the Newnham Action Group - as we are so lucky to have a large and diverse female student population, we have created this as a platform for sharing information about organisations and causes. This is student led, so please join the group and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/261161827661321/">get involved</a>  </br>
      </br>
      If you would like more information about being a female student at Cambridge, or Women’s Rights in the setting of graduate education please follow the link for the <a href="https://www.womens.cusu.cam.ac.uk/">CUSU Women’s Campaign</a>  </br>
