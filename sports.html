        <h1>Sports and Gym</h1>

        <h3>Newnham Gym</h3>
        <p>Newnham is getting a brand new purpose-built gym! It will be free for all students who live in college and only £10 per term for those who live out. The gym will have very generous opening hours, with some hours in which staff may use the gym, but by nature it will be female-only for the majority of the time. The gym will have a range of equipment, including treadmills, cross-trainers, ergos, weights machines and free weights. The gym will be card-access once you have completed an induction - more information about the gym will be made available once it is all known. </p>
        
        <h3>Other Gyms</h3>
        <p>Newnham students can also use the university gym, located in West Cambridge. Students must pay to use this gym – for more information please see the <a href="https://www.sport.cam.ac.uk/" target="_blank" title="Meal Bookings">website </a>. There is also the <a href="http://www.unicen.cam.ac.uk/blue-fitness" target="_blank" title="Meal Bookings">Blue Fitness Gym </a> – a smaller University owned gym in Newnham. </br> 
          </br>
        For those who don’t live in college and don’t/can’t use the college gym there are many other gyms in Cambridge. For a list of the City Council-run sports facilities please see this <a href="https://www.cambridge.gov.uk/sport-and-fitness-facilities" target="_blank" title="Meal Bookings">website </a>  and there are links below to several of the popular gyms, most of which do student or off-peak membership, which keeps the cost down </br>

        <h2>Sports at Newnham </h2>
        <h3>Newnham College Boat Club </h3>
        <p>The Newnham College Boat Club (NCBC) has a an excellent reputation in rowing, and was the first college to participate in women’s rowing when it started at the university. NCBC welcome novices (those who have never rowed before) and experienced rowers – for information on joining please see the <a href="http://newnhamcollegeboatclub.com/" target="_blank" title="Meal Bookings">NCBC website </a>   </p>

        <h3>Other Sports and Fitness Activities </h3>
        <p>Newnham is lucky enough to have on-site sports facilities; we have sports fields, netball courts, tennis course and the gym! The tennis courts can be booked by any member of the college and the MCR has some sports equipment (cricket sets, darts, badminton rackets, boules sets) that can be loaned to any MCR members. </br> 
          </br> 
        The JCR and MCR run classes for students at Newnham during term time. In the past this has included Zumba and Yoga, but varies from year to year. These are a fantastic way to keep healthy and meet people at college, and they are very reasonably priced! Information about any such classes will be shared during term time via the weekly MCR bulletin, on the MCR notice boards (outside the buttery and in the MCR) and on the Newnham MCR Facebook page. </br> 
        </br> 
        For more information about sport at Newnham please see the <a href="http://www.newn.cam.ac.uk/student-life/societies-and-facilities/sports/" target="_blank" title="Meal Bookings">NCBC main college website </a>  or email the MCR committee!  </p>
